# 🟣 Purple Team Labs

This repository contains hands-on labs and notes that bridge the gap between offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations. My goal is to simulate real-world adversary behavior (Red Team) and develop effective detection and response strategies (Blue Team) using a Purple Team approach.

## 🔍 What's Inside

### 🔴 Red Team
- Enumeration techniques
- Exploit development practice
- Privilege escalation labs
- C2 framework testing (Covenant, Sliver)

### 🔵 Blue Team
- Log analysis and correlation (Splunk, ELK)
- SIEM search queries
- Sysmon rule tuning
- Detection engineering and alert logic

### 🟣 Purple Team
- MITRE ATT&CK tactic-to-detection mapping
- Atomic Red Team simulations
- Detection-as-Code with Sigma rules
- Purple workflows and playbooks

## 🛠️ Tools and Tech
- **C2:** Sliver, Covenant, Metasploit
- **Detection:** Splunk, Sigma, YARA, Sysmon
- **Scripting:** Python, PowerShell
- **Frameworks:** MITRE ATT&CK, Atomic Red Team

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Build adversary emulation labs
- Develop and test detections for real TTPs
- Understand attack paths and visibility gaps
- Improve collaboration between red and blue ops
